Other popular breakfast items include **dosa** (a crispy rice crepe), **upma** (a savory semolina dish), and **poha** (flattened rice cooked with spices and vegetables).

Karnataka's breakfast scene also highlights local specialties referred to as *Today's Special*, which may vary by establishment. Udupi cuisine, renowned for its vegetarian offerings, is especially noted through its hotels and restaurants, where you can explore these traditional dishes.

Given the prominence of these breakfasts in Karnataka, many medium-priced hotels in district headquarters like Mangaluru, Udupi, and Shivamogga typically provide South Indian buffet breakfasts, allowing guests to sample a variety of local delicacies. So, whether you're enjoying idli with coconut chutney or vada dipped in sambar, expect a satisfying start to your day!"
